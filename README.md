# Liquid-Petroleum-Gas-LPG-Distribution-in-UNHCR-AoR-16-Camps
- Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) Distribution in Bangladesh operation UNHCR AoR 16 Camps
- With the arrival of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh in August 2017, the total number of Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar district increased to nearly one million, mostly occupying the conserved forest land surrounding the existing two refugee camps (Kutupalong Registered Camp and Nayapara Registered Camp), resulting in massive deforestation in the area as people cut down trees for firewood and to build shelters. The natural biodiversity of this reserve forest zone was deeply affected including disruption to the elephant corridor. 
- To address the environmental impact of the presence of one million refugees, mitigate protection risks when refugees, especially women, and girls, collect firewood in the forest, and promote social cohesion between refugees and the host community, UNHCR and IOM have introduced the distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) since 2018. The provision of LPG cylinders also increases health and nutritional benefits to the refugees. In the meantime, partners of the Joint Response Plan (JRP) invested significant resources and efforts to regreen the camps through tree plantation and watershed restoration.

- LPG distribution centres are set up in the camps with a monthly coverage of over 7,000 households per centre. The suppliers are responsible for delivering the LPG cylinders to the distribution centres, where refugees will return empty cylinders in exchange for a new one. 
- All refugee households in the camps receive LPG from UNHCR. The allocation of LPG is based on the household size as per UNHCR’s registration database. As such, refugees with different household sizes have different refilling cycles to ensure adequate and fair provision of cooking fuel
